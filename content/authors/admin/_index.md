    summary: Created a multimodal model to infer the admixture history of recent 1600~ comunities from their local ancestry tracts.
      Responsibilities include:
      - Simulation of Family Pedigrees dating back to 1600~
      - Admixture History Inference from multimodal dataset of time series (admixture history) and count data (continuous local ancestry tracts)
      - Inference of Admixture History from only ancestry traits of communities that share a common genetic ancestor

    summary: | Created a simulation based inferene method to infer the evolutionary parameters that impact allele frequencies and effect sizes observed in traits in the UK Biobank.
      Responsibilities include:
      - Scaling liklihood inference model to ~150 million alleles that included very rare alleles with a minior allele frequency > .0001
      - Building an end to end model for determining causal variants while also quantifying selection in traits from the UK Biobank
